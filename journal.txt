TODOs:

- the "shake" avatar effect
- note track..think about best way to get the path
- script to modify META files automatically for textures:
	textureFormat: -1 to -3 (disable compression)
	filterMode: -1 to 0 (no filtering)
	wrapMode: -1 to 1 (clamp, don't wrap)

	Nice to have:
	BLEND MODES!! blend mode -> shader choice
		don't strictly need this now - Zak only uses them for background, which we can merge/export
		export opacity
		pass through
		normal
		multiply
		overlay

- "dance" animation script for avatars. bounce back and forth?

CANCELED:

- AI defend pcode:

quantize input and analyze..

be "greedy" about chords, ie. starting from a note, consider all notes after within THRESH to be a chord

for each note, roll dice for:
	- how quickly is it following previous note? SPD check
	- is it a different key? DEX check
	- how different is the timing from the previous note (ignore sustains)? RHY check
	- is it a chord? how many notes? CHO check
	- is it sustained? how long? SUS check

- Test on myself by randomly choosing an AI and see if I can figure it out.
